# DragonFlagon Manual Rolls

Allows you to enter the individual dice results when making any kind of roll. This can be great for both testing your game (where you want to roll a specific number) or if you're using real dice and want Foundry to figure out all the math.

Given the limitations of Foundry around Rolling (namely that rolls are not Asynchronous) it is difficult to really do any kind of overhaul of the roll system. But I've found a way using good ol' fashioned prompts!
