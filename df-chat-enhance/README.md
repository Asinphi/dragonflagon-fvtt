# DragonFlagon Chat Enhancements

Multiple improvements to the chat system feature set. Brings a new Chat Archive that lets you save your current chat log to an archive and keep the chat clean between sessions. Gives an option to replace the Roll Type dropdown menu with a set of 4 buttons. This makes switching rolls much more efficient and provides a better visual indicator for what roll you're in.

## Chat Archive

The chat archive is a large component of this module. It allows you to save either all of your current messages, or a selected date range of messages. When you save the messages, you can choose to have them automatically deleted from the chat log. Once you have an archive, you can go to the settings tab and click the new "Manage Chat Archive" button to see your archives. Simply click any archive and it will open a viewer window where you can see the old chats!

### Create Archive

To create an archive, simply click the new "Archive chat log" button that is now beside the "save" and "delete" buttons in the chat sidebar. ![archive button](../.assets/df-chat-enhance-archive-new.png)

|:-:|:-:|
|![Create chat archive window](../.assets/df-chat-enhance-archive-new-window.png)|![Create chat archive window](../.assets/df-chat-enhance-archive-new-window-date.png)|

The windows is fairly self explanatory, you can select all the current chat messages for archiving, or you can select a local date range.

### Manage Chat Archives

You can view and delete archives from the archive manager. You'll find the ![manage chat archive](../.assets/df-chat-enhance-archive-manage-button.png) button in the sidebar settings tab.
